# Microclimate

Detailed information about the microclimate model can be found at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-44734-0. The source scripts of the regularized optimal fingerprinting algorithm, available at https://github.com/pinplex/PyDnA, have been slightly tuned to enhance their applicability to tropical forest microclimate.
